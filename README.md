# Code I wrote the research projects during my Ph.D.
# 
# File descriptions:
# 
# create_input_files.py 
# - create the ".inp" files from which Abaqus finite element method (FEM) simulations can be performed
# - Abaqus 2019 was used
# 
# run_multiple_jobs.bat
# - run all the ".inp" files in a folder using Abaqus from Windows cmd
# 
# fetch_node_displacement.py
# - fetch single node displacement values from the simulation results and save an excel file with the values tabulated
#
# LPU_data_analysis.py
# - analyse the data from experiments and FEM results with elastic-plastic fracture mechanics and output the J-integral R-curve
